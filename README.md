<h2 align="center">An exclusive social networking community for App Academy software engineers.</h2> <h3 align="center">Created by Ying-Huan, Thomas Grega, Suliz Basnet, and Clint Chu.</h3>

<p>
JobieWalkie is collaborated effort to improve the job search process for software engineers, particularly App Academy job seekers. Job searching can be a tedious and/or disorganized task for any occupation where ambiguity in job titles, job descriptions, job requirements, and etc is rampant. The effort becomes more cumbersome as job postings can become old or newer job postings, prime listings, are buried in an ocean of links. JobieWalkie was designed reduce these issues by aggregating the latest job listings from LinkedIn, filtering job postings relevant to App Academy students' skillset, and providing a peer-to-peer community to assist fellow students in the search.

## Design and Technologies

Primarily, built on a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), the database is populated by the Puppeteer webscraper API, the interactive map is powered by the Google Maps API to provide the location of where the job is.

Currently, the app provides the latest job postings on LinkedIn, narrowed down to software engineering positions that require tools and technologies such as Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Express.js, Node.js, HTML/CSS, PostgresSQL, and MongoDB (these are the tools and technologies App Academy students know upon graduation).
